# Rutgers Thesis / Dissertation Latex Template

A latex template for Rutgers MS Thesis or PhD Dissertation

## Introduciton

This latex template is based on the examples provided on official [Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Style Guide](https://gsnb.rutgers.edu/academics/electronic-thesis-and-dissertation-style-guide) (See [Official Examples](https://github.com/tangbao/RU-Thesis-Dissertation-Latex-Template/tree/master/OfficialExamples) to find the snapshot of the guidance and original pdf examples, updated on April 2019) and the latex template from [Georgia Tech Thesis Templates](http://grad.gatech.edu/theses-dissertations-templates).

You can check the generated [example pdf file](https://github.com/tangbao/RU-Thesis-Dissertation-Latex-Template/blob/master/Thesis_Example.pdf) of the template.

It's a little bit different from the official examples, but I think it is OK because my thesis using this template has been approved by the Graduate Director (haven't submitted to the [RUetd](https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/etd/) yet, will update if anything wrong). You can modify anything you want in the template to meet your program's requirements.

## How to use

**!!! READ THE OFFICIAL GUIDANCE BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE !!!**

**!!! READ THE COMMENTS CAREFULLY IN TEMPLATES !!!**

Use your favorite Latex editor to edit all the .tex/.bib files under the [template](https://github.com/tangbao/RU-Thesis-Dissertation-Latex-Template/tree/master/template) folder, or you can upload all the files onto an online Latex editor like OverLeaf.

You have to modify your information in the main.tex Line 23 - 36 to for Latex to generate the thesis/dissertation style correctly, then, just start writing your thesis/dissertation as normal.

## Bugs / TODO

When you click the link in the menu, it might jump to a wrong page, especially for the intro pages (e.g., the acknowledgment, abstract, etc.). Will fix it soon.
